## Architecture

### Core Modules

| Module | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Shade Library** | `lib/tryon/shade-library.ts` | 52 professional shades with RGB/HSL data, opacity, intensity, shimmer flags |
| **Color Engine** | `lib/tryon/color-engine.ts` | Soft-light & overlay blending, root shadow, vertical gradient, pixel-level color application |
| **Hair Segmentation** | `lib/tryon/hair-segmentation.ts` | Color-space based hair detection, region zones (roots/crown/mid/ends), mask smoothing |
| **AR Camera View** | `components/tryon/ar-tryon-view.tsx` | Real-time webcam processing, camera switching, live preview |
| **Photo Try-On** | `components/tryon/photo-tryon.tsx` | Upload-based before/after comparison with draggable slider |
| **Shade Picker** | `components/tryon/shade-picker.tsx` | Filterable shade grid with tone pills, search, brand filtering |

### Data Flow

```
Camera/Upload → ImageData → Hair Segmentation → Mask Generation
                                                      ↓
Color Engine ← Shade Definition ← User Selection ← Shade Library
      ↓
Blended ImageData → Canvas Render → Live Preview
```

## Shade Library

### Coverage: 52 Shades

| Brand | Line | Shades | Categories |
|-------|------|--------|------------|
| **Davines** | View | 32 | Natural (10N–10N), Ash (5A–8A), Golden (5G–8G), Copper (5C–7C), Red (4R–6R), Violet (6V–7V), Pearl (7P–9P), Beige (7D–8D), Mahogany (4M–5M), Chocolate (4CH–5CH) |
| **Davines** | A New Colour | 6 | Natural series (4.0–8.0), Golden (7.3) |
| **Davines** | Mask Vibrachrom | 3 | Fashion semi-colors (Rose Quartz, Living Coral, Lavender Haze) |
| **Universal** | — | 9 | Platinum, Silver, Rose Gold, Honey Blonde, Caramel, Espresso, Auburn, Burgundy, Ice Blonde |

### Shade Properties

Each shade includes:
- **RGB/HSL values** — Precise color coordinates
- **Level (1–10)** — Lightness scale from black to lightest blonde
- **Tone family** — neutral, ash, golden, copper, red, violet, pearl, beige, mahogany, chocolate, warm, cool, pink, silver, platinum
- **Opacity (0–1)** — How opaque the color overlay renders
- **Intensity (0–1)** — Saturation strength during blending
- **Shimmer flag** — Whether the shade has reflective/metallic qualities
- **Category** — permanent, demi, semi, toner, lightener

## Hair Segmentation

### Segmentation Modes

| Mode | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Auto** | Bell-curve weighted full-head detection | Default, best overall |
| **Full** | Complete hair silhouette | Full color change |
| **Headband** | Forehead-to-crown strip | Root touch-up preview |
| **Roots** | Upper 25% of frame | Root retouch visualization |
| **Mid-lengths** | 25–60% zone | Balayage mid-section |
| **Ends** | Lower 45% zone | Dip-dye / ombré preview |
| **Highlights** | High-brightness regions only | Highlight-only color |

### Detection Algorithm

The segmentation uses color-space heuristics (no ML dependency required):

1. **Skin detection** — RGB ratio analysis to exclude face/neck
2. **Background rejection** — Extreme luminance and uniform color filtering
3. **Hair color scoring** — Based on luminance, saturation, and color channel relationships
4. **Position weighting** — Region-specific probability curves
5. **Mask smoothing** — Gaussian blur for natural edge transitions

### Output

- **Uint8Array mask** — Per-pixel confidence (0–255)
- **Region descriptors** — Bounding boxes and labels for detected zones
- **Overall confidence** — Aggregate segmentation quality score

## Color Engine

### Blending Modes

| Mode | Algorithm | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Natural** | Soft-light | Realistic everyday colors |
| **Vibrant** | Overlay | Bold, saturated results |
| **Subtle** | Soft-light at 50% opacity | Tinted/demi results |
| **Fashion** | Overlay + color-dodge shimmer | Vivid fashion colors, metallics |

### Root Shadow

Dynamically darkens the shade at the root zone (top 30% of hair) by a configurable factor (default 15%), creating a natural-looking shadow effect.

### Vertical Gradient Processing

```
Roots (top 30%)    → Slightly darker (-10%)
Mid-lengths (40%)  → Standard intensity
Ends (bottom 30%)  → Slightly lighter (+5%) — simulates porous ends
```

## Demo Page

### Standalone HTML (`/ar-demo.html`)

A self-contained demo page that requires no build step or server dependencies. Features:

- ✅ Live camera preview with real-time color application
- ✅ 52-shade library with tone filtering and search
- ✅ 4 blend modes (Natural, Vibrant, Subtle, Fashion)
- ✅ 4 segmentation modes (Auto, Full, Roots, Mid-lengths)
- ✅ Intensity slider (0–100%)
- ✅ Camera switching (front/rear)
- ✅ Hair mask overlay (hover to reveal)
- ✅ Selected shade info panel
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### Access URL

When the Next.js dashboard is running:
```
http://localhost:3001/ar-demo.html
```

Or served directly from any static file server.

## Integration Points

### Dashboard Page (`/tryon`)

Full Next.js page with:
- Live AR camera mode
- Photo upload mode with before/after slider

## For Tiche — Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open `ar-demo.html` in browser
- [ ] Click "Start Camera" and allow camera access
- [ ] Select a shade from the grid (try 7G Golden Blonde)
- [ ] Verify color applies to hair region only
- [ ] Try different blend modes — Natural vs Vibrant
- [ ] Switch segmentation to "Roots" — should only color top portion
- [ ] Adjust intensity slider — color should fade smoothly
- [ ] Test multiple shades across tones (ash, copper, red)
- [ ] Stop camera and verify clean shutdown
- [ ] Test on mobile phone for front/rear camera switching
