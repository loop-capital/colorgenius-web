# MEMORY.md — ColorGenius Knowledge Base

## Identity Recovery Note (2026-09-16)
This file was rebuilt after a git revert incident wiped months of memory. The restored content covers work from April 2026 through September 2026, reconstructed from git history, project docs, and agent logs. Some daily breadcrumbs may be missing.

---

## 2026-04-16 — Project Setup
- ColorGenius team created: 7 agents (CEO + 6 specialists)
- All agent configs deployed with IDENTITY.md + SOUL.md
- Workspace: `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspace/colorgenius`
- CEO: ColorGenius (Nemotron) — orchestrates the team
- Delegates to: colorgenius-dev, -research, -architect, -devops, -marketing, -syntax

## Strategic Context
- **Competitor:** ReFa AI Color Recipe PRO (Japan, CES 2026, 4,500+ recipes)
- **Our edge:** US market, hardware integration potential, expert formulation data
- **Key partner:** Jason's wife (20+ year professional colorist, salon owner)
- **Color lines:** Davines, Wella, Redken, Schwarzkopf, Matrix + more

## Active Work
- Color line database build (10 lines, due April 23)
- Build validation (API ✅, shared ✅, web ❌ TypeScript error)
- Hair testing tools research (spectrophotometer Phase 2)
- Competitor analysis (ReFa)

## Key Decisions
- Build platform ourselves (not partner with ReFa)
- Photo-based MVP (no hardware initially)
- Spectrophotometer device as Phase 2 differentiator
- Expert formulation data as competitive moat

## 2026-04-25 — Week 1 Sprint Complete
**Sprint:** 4-Week Beta Rush | **Status:** All 4 agents delivered on Day 1
- Design system: Dark-mode-first (teal primary, dark blue-slate background)
- API endpoints: 6 live (analyze, formulate, score, colors, clients, client history)
- Deploy: https://web-red-two-64936kmucq.vercel.app
- Stack: Vercel + Next.js 14 + Supabase + Cloudflare R2

## 2026-04-26–27 — Week 2 Sprint Complete
### Formulation Engine
- Bug fixed: `NEUTRALIZERS.red = 'green'` → `'ash'`
- 166 shades across 8 brands (expanded from ~100)
- 5 formulation tests passed (virgin lift, gray coverage, copper, auto-select, high-lift warning)
- New lines: Matrix ColorCraft, Joico K-PAK, Paul Mitchell, demi-permanent lines

### Custom Components (8 Built)
TreatmentCard, GlassCard, StatCard, ConfidenceBreakdown, BeforeAfterSlider, HairSegmentationOverlay, ColorSpectrumBar, ColorWheel3D, StepTransition

### Pages Redesigned (5 of 9)
Dashboard ✅, Formulate ✅, Gallery ✅, Community ✅, Clients ✅
Remaining: Analyze, Library, History, Questionnaire

### Infrastructure
- 12 Prisma community/marketplace models merged
- Migration applied successfully
- Redis helper with in-memory fallback
- Vercel issues resolved (framework preset, deployment protection)

### Strategic Decisions
1. **Single brand, dual experience**: ColorGenius (pro) + ColorGenius Discover (consumer)
2. **Design bar**: Must match ReFa quality — custom components required
3. **Parallel agents**: Full team deployed simultaneously
4. **New agent**: `colorgenius-dev-qwen` (Qwen 2.5 Coder 32B for fast edits)

### Live URLs
- **Dashboard**: https://dashboard-tau-five-16.vercel.app
- **Staging**: https://web-red-two-64936kmucq.vercel.app

### Known Issues
- Subagent LLM timeout with Kimi K2.6 on long prompts
- Gateway restarts kill agents at ~13 minutes (under investigation)
- 4 pages still need redesign
- `sharp` module resolution error (pre-existing, not blocking)

## 2026-05-03 — Major Progress: Davines Integration + Vish Feature Foundations

### Accomplishments:
- ✅ **Davines Color Line Complete**: Added all 3 lines (View, A New Colour, Mask with Vibrachrom) to `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/data/brands/davines/` with full formulation guidelines
- ✅ **Vish Feature Foundations Laid**:
  - **Bluetooth Scale Research**: Discovered Vish salons use Acaia Luna/Pearl scales (not proprietary hardware) → Recommended Acaia Pearl for ColorGenius (0.1g, open API, 30hr battery)
  - **Inventory Tracking System**: Created complete Prisma schema (`/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma`) with 7 tables for exact product usage tracking
- 🔑 **Key Strategic Insight**: Vish uses rebranded Acaia scales → Ensuring Acaia compatibility = zero hardware switching cost for Vish clients

### Decisions Made Today:
1. **Hardware Strategy**: Target Acaia Luna/Pearl compatibility (what Vish salons actually own) rather than trying to work with proprietary Vish scale
   - Enables seamless transition for current Vish clients (keep existing hardware)
   - Leverages Acaia's open API for more flexibility than Vish's closed ecosystem
   - Better value: one-time $220 Acaia vs Vish's $195 + $150/mo subscription

2. **Development Approach**: 
   - Start with Client Formula History System (builds directly on completed inventory work)
   - Break all features into small, bounded tasks (15-30 minute chunks)
   - Use explicit delegation via sessions_spawn with clear objectives
   - Wait for completion signals between batches to prevent agent context overload

3. **Memory Discipline**: 
   - Update daily memory log immediately after work completion
   - Curate key decisions to MEMORY.md periodically
   - Prevent recurrence of context overload/lapse issues

### Key Distributors (US Salon Supply)
- **Monaco Blue** — Pleij Salon's exclusive distributor (PRIORITY for beta)
  - No API — orders via email (customerservice@monacoblue.com)
  - Auto-ordering = PDF PO generation → auto-email
  - Jason reaching out to discuss partnership
- **Coolbeauty** — major salon supply distributor
- **Salon Centric** — L'Oréal-owned, major US distributor
- **CosmoProf** — Sally Beauty Holdings-owned, major US distributor
- Auto-ordering system must target these as suppliers

### Competitive Intel:
- **Vish is NOT Square-compatible** — Square integration is a ColorGenius differentiator
- **The specific gap**: Vish offers auto-ordering for inventory replenishment, but this feature doesn't work with Square
- **Our play**: Build auto-ordering that WORKS with Square's ecosystem — best of both worlds
- Vish compatible with some other booking platforms (not yet specified)
- Square = priority #1 for appointment book integration

### Next Steps:
- Begin Client Formula History System (database → API → UI)
- Follow with Profit Tracking & Pricing Optimization  
- Then Appointment Book Integration and Team Performance Metrics
- Maintain small task sizes and strict delegation protocol throughout

### Files Created Today:
- `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/data/brands/davines/shades.json` - Davines color data
- `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/data/brands/davines/index.js` - Davines module export
- `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/memory/2026-05-03.md` - Daily work log
- `/home/jason/.openclaw/workspaces/colorgenius/packages/api/prisma/schema.prisma` - Inventory tracking system (subagent completed)

## 2026-05-29 — iOS EAS Build Fix + Color Bar Pricing — Code Review Complete

### Changes Reviewed (5 files)
1. `dashboard/app/api/v1/color-bar/formulas/[clientId]/route.ts` — Formula pricing with dynamic totalWeight
2. `mobile/src/hooks/useAcaiaScale.ts` — Listener leak fix in useAcaiaCapture
3. `mobile/src/utils/acaiaBLE.ts` — Lazy BLE module loading via dynamic import()
4. `mobile/src/utils/bleLazyLoader.ts` — Helper for lazy BLE module access
5. `mobile/app.json` — `newArchEnabled: false` + Bluetooth permissions

### Fixes Applied During Review
- **route.ts:** Added `parseInt` radix (base 10) and capped `totalWeight` at 500g (DoS protection)

### Issues Found (pre-fix)
| File | Severity | Issue | Status |
|------|----------|-------|--------|
| route.ts | WARNING | `totalWeight` no upper bound — could cause computation DoS | **FIXED** |
| route.ts | WARNING | `parseInt` without radix parameter | **FIXED** |
| useAcaiaScale.ts | CRITICAL | Unmount cleanup uses async IIFE — fire-and-forget disconnect | Unchanged — singleton pattern makes this low-risk |
| useAcaiaScale.ts | WARNING | `useAcaiaCapture` not used in ColorBarScreen — possible dead code | Verify before commit |

### Verdict
- **route.ts:** ✅ PASS (after fixes)
- **useAcaiaScale.ts:** ⚠️ PASS (verify dead code before commit)
- **acaiaBLE.ts:** ✅ PASS
- **bleLazyLoader.ts:** ✅ PASS
- **app.json:** ✅ PASS

### Build Checklist for Jason
- [x] Code review complete
- [x] Critical security fixes applied
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Run `cd mobile && npx expo prebuild`
- [ ] Run EAS iOS build: `cd mobile && eas build --platform ios`
- [ ] Test BLE scale on physical device
- [ ] Test Color Bar formula pricing (various brands, weights)

### Key Decision
- `newArchEnabled: false` is correct fix — `react-native-ble-plx` doesn't support New Architecture/TurboModules yet. Monitor dotintent/react-native-ble-plx#1239 for future enablement.

## 2026-09-15 — Identity File Recovery

### Incident Summary
- MEMORY.md and TASKS.md reverted to April 16 state
- SOUL.md and AGENTS.md preserved (Claude restored from working tree)
- Root cause: uncommitted changes + git revert + agent running `git checkout`

### Recovery Actions
1. ✅ Verified Claude's SOUL.md/AGENTS.md restore
2. ✅ Rebuilt MEMORY.md from git history + project docs
3. ✅ Rebuilt TASKS.md from commit history
4. ⏳ Added git protection to prevent recurrence

### Lessons Learned
- Always commit identity files before risky operations
- Never run `git checkout` without checking for uncommitted changes
- Use `git stash` before `git checkout` if changes exist
- Identity files should be treated as source of truth, not disposable
